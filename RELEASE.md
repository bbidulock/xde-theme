Maintenance Release 1.3
=======================

This is the third release of the xde-theme package.  This package
contains various tools for setting themes for a wide range of
light-weight window managers.  These tools are meant to have minimal
dependencies, GTK2-based, and each tool able to run independent of the
others (and, for that matter, independent of the desktop environment):
they work well with many light-weight window managers.  I use these
tools daily and they are quite stable.

This release is a maintenance release whose sole purpose is to update
the build system, generate a better NEWS files, handles annotated tags
better, and converts the release archives to lzip compression.

Included in the release is an autoconf tarball for building the release
from source.  See the [NEWS](NEWS) and [TODO](TODO) file in the release
for more information.  Please report problems to the issues list on
[GitHub](https://github.com/bbidulock/xde-theme/issues).
