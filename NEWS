Release xde-theme-1.5 released 2021-05-09
-----------------------------------------

git tag -n100 -l 1.5

1.5             Maintenance Release 1.5

    This is the fifth release of the xde-theme package. This package
    contains various tools for setting themes for a wide range of
    light-weight window managers. These tools are meant to have minimal
    dependencies, GTK2-based, and each tool able to run independent of the
    others (and, for that matter, independent of the desktop environment):
    they work well with many light-weight window managers. I use these
    tools daily and they are quite stable.

    This release is a maintenance release whose sole purpose is to update
    the build system and support symbol versioning under gcc 10.2.0
    compiler.

    Included in the release is an autoconf tarball for building the release
    from source. See the NEWS and TODO file in the release for more
    information. Please report problems to the issues list on GitHub.
