xde-styles
==========

Package xde-styles-1.1 was released under CCPL:cc-by-sa-3.0 license
2013-12-20. 

This is a set of styles for the XDE (X Desktop Environment) which
provides a small and consistent set of window manager styles across a
wide range of light-weight window managers.  The purpose is to provide a
consistent visual appearance for the X Desktop Environment across all
supported window managers.

Release
-------

This is the xde-styles-1.1 package, released 2013-12-20.  This release,
and the latest version, can be obtained from the GitHub repository at
(http://github.com/bbidulock/xde-styles), using a command such as:

    $> git clone http://github.com/bbidulock/xde-styles.git

Please see the `NEWS' file for release notes and history of user visible
changes for the current version, and the `ChangeLog' file for a more
detailed history of implementation changes.  The `TODO' file lists
features not yet implemented and other outstanding items.

Please see the `INSTALL' file for installation instructions.

When working from `git(1)', please see the `README-git' file.  An
abbreviated installation procedure that works for most applications
appears below.

This release is published under the CCPL:cc-by-sa-3.0 (primarily because
the base styles used to develop these styles were licensed under this
license).  Please see the license in the file `COPYING'.

Quick Start:
------------

The quickest and easiest way to get xde-styles up and running is to run
the following commands:

    $> git clone http://github.com/bbidulock/xde-styles.git
    $> cd xde-styles
    $> ./autogen.sh
    $> ./configure --prefix=/usr
    $> make V=0
    $> make DESTDIR="$pkgdir" install

This will configure, compile and install xde-styles the quickest.  For
those who would like to spend the extra 15 seconds reading ./configure
--help, some compile time options can be turned on and off before the
build.

For general information on GNU's ./configure, see the file `INSTALL'.

Window manager support:
-----------------------

The following set of supported window managers (alphabetically):
blackbox(1), ctwm(1), fluxbox(1), fvwm(1), icewm(1), jwm(1), mwm(1),
openbox(1), pekwm(1), twm(1), vtwm(1), wmaker(1).  Also provided is
gtk-2.0 style files consistent with the window manager style.

Of these window managers, blackbox(1), fluxbox(1), icewm(1), openbox(1),
pekwm(1) and wmaker(1) provide a native style system and the styles
provided are consistent with their style systems.

ctwm(1), vtwm(1) and twm(1) do not provide a native style system, but
have a powerful configuration system.  ctwm-themes is available for
ctwm(1), but the styles provided here are not consistent with
ctwm-themes.  A style system based on m4 rc files that works with
ctwm(1), vtwm(1) and twm(1) are provided in this package.  Take a look
at the scripts and base files provided in the /usr/share/*twm
directories after installation to see how it works.

jwm(1) does not provide a native styles system and typically runs from a
single configuration file; however, it does have a powerful
configuration file mechanism.  A sytle system based on xml configuration
files is provided in this package.  Take a look at the scripts and base
files provided in the /usr/share/jwm directory after installation to see
how it works.

fvwm(1) does not provide a native style system.  fvwm-themes is
available for fvwm(1), but the styles provided here are not consistent
with fvwm-themes.  fvwm(1) does provide a (too?) powerful configuration
system and a style system based on fvwm configuration files similar to
(but much more simple than) fvwm-themes is provided in this package.

Styles:
-------

The styles provided by the package are based on the `Squared' styles
available for fluxbox(1) developed by endel (endel@tlen.pl) and
distributed under cc-by-sa-3.0, but have been enhanced and extended.

All of the variations have the following features: flat title bars and
borders that are predominately blackish (greyish for Squared-grey).  A
set of flat squared, (rectangular actually), title bar buttons with a
highlight color fading from the outer to inner title bar button.  An
overlaid bitmap pattern on hightlight, hover, or pressed that reveals
the primary title bar button function.  The style for the title bar is
extended to panels, docks, harbours, slits, root menus, window menus and
other window manager styled components.  The style also extends to a
gtk-2.0 style of the same name that can be used for Gtk2 applications
that want their style to be consistent with that of the window manager
elements.

The variations of this style are as follows:

Squared-blue: Predominately blackish background with azure blue buttons
and highlight colors.

Squared-green: Predominately blackish background with forest green
buttons and highlight colors.

Squared-cadet: Predominately blackish background with cadet blue (sea
blue really) buttons and highlight colors.

Squared-grey: Predominately light greyish (slight blue tinge) background
with dark gray buttons and hightlight colors.

Adding your own styles:
-----------------------

The styles provided in the package provided can easily be adapted to
provide your own consistent set of styles across the supported window
managers and to integrate your styles with the various style systems.
